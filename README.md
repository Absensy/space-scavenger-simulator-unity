# Space Scavenger Simulator

A Unity-based space scavenging game where players pilot a spaceship to collect space debris using a tractor beam system.

## Overview

Space Scavenger Simulator is a physics-based space exploration game where you control a spaceship equipped with a tractor beam. Your mission is to collect space debris (trash) scattered across the environment and deliver it to your base for processing.

## Features

### Current Implementation
- **Player Spaceship Control**: Physics-based movement with forward/backward thrust and rotation
- **Tractor Beam System**: Target and capture space debris within range
- **Base Collection System**: Deliver collected items to the base for processing
- **Physics-Based Gameplay**: Realistic physics interactions with rigidbodies and joints

### Controls
- **WASD / Arrow Keys**: Move forward/backward and turn
- **Space**: Activate tractor beam to capture targeted debris
- **G**: Release currently held object

## Technical Details

### Unity Version
- Unity 2022.3 LTS or later (recommended)

### Key Packages
- Universal Render Pipeline (URP) 17.0.4
- Input System 1.14.0
- AI Navigation 2.0.7
